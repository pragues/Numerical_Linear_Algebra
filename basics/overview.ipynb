    "[BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/) specification for low-level matrix and vector arithmetic operations. These are the standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. BLAS originated as a Fortran library in 1979. Examples of BLAS libraries include: AMD Core Math Library (ACML), ATLAS, Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), and [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS) \n",
    "\n",
    "[LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/) is written in Fortran, provides routines for solving systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. Matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur). Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. Real and complex, single and double precision.
